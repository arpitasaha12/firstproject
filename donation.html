            <h2>Food for a family</h2>
            <p>A food is something that provides nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide: energy
                for activity,
                growth, and all functions of the body such as breathing, digesting food, and keeping warm; materials for
                the
                growth and repair of the body, and for keeping the immune system healthy.</p>

        <div id="family" class="boxes">
            <h2>Shelter for a family</h2>
            <p>Shelter is a basic human need crucial for survival in cases of natural hazards or conflict. It provides
                security, personal safety and protection from the weather, and prevents ill health and disease. Adequate
                housing provides people with dignity and the opportunity to lead a normal life.</p>

        <div id="education" class="boxes">
            <h2>Education for a child</h2>
            <p>Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty; supporting child survival, growth,
                development and well-being; and closing the gap in social inequality. On average, one additional year of
                education can increase an individual's earnings by 10 per cent.</p>
